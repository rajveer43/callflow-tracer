# Advanced Graph Layouts

CallFlow Tracer now supports **9 advanced graph layout algorithms** to visualize your function call flows in different ways. Each layout offers unique insights into your code's execution patterns.

## Available Layouts

### 1. üìä Hierarchical Layout
**Best for:** Understanding call hierarchies and dependencies

Traditional top-down tree structure that clearly shows parent-child relationships between function calls.

**Features:**
- Clear hierarchy visualization
- Automatic level-based positioning
- No overlapping nodes
- Static layout (no physics)

**Use when:** You want to see the clear call stack and function hierarchy.

---

### 2. üåÄ Force-Directed Layout
**Best for:** Discovering natural clusters and relationships

Physics-based layout using the ForceAtlas2 algorithm. Nodes repel each other while edges act as springs, creating organic groupings.

**Features:**
- Automatic clustering of related functions
- Dynamic physics simulation
- Natural spacing
- Interactive repositioning

**Use when:** You want to discover hidden patterns and natural groupings in your code.

---

### 3. ‚≠ï Circular Layout
**Best for:** Comparing all functions equally

Arranges all nodes in a perfect circle, giving equal visual weight to each function.

**Features:**
- Equal spacing around circumference
- Clear edge patterns
- Symmetrical layout
- Static positioning

**Use when:** You want to see all functions at once without hierarchy bias.

---

### 4. üéØ Radial Tree Layout
**Best for:** Visualizing depth levels and call propagation

Arranges nodes in concentric circles based on their depth in the call tree. Root functions are at the center, with child calls radiating outward.

**Features:**
- Depth-based concentric circles
- Clear level separation
- Radial symmetry
- BFS-based positioning

**Use when:** You want to see how calls propagate through different depth levels.

---

### 5. üìê Grid Layout
**Best for:** Systematic comparison and uniform spacing

Arranges nodes in a uniform grid pattern, making it easy to scan and compare functions systematically.

**Features:**
- Uniform row/column spacing
- Predictable positioning
- Easy scanning
- Adjustable density

**Use when:** You need a systematic, organized view of all functions.

---

### 6. üå≤ Tree (Vertical) Layout
**Best for:** Traditional call stack visualization

Enhanced vertical tree with customizable spacing between nodes and levels.

**Features:**
- Top-down flow
- Customizable node spacing
- Level separation control
- Tree spacing adjustment

**Use when:** You want a traditional call stack view with fine-tuned spacing.

---

### 7. üå≥ Tree (Horizontal) Layout
**Best for:** Wide call graphs with many branches

Left-to-right tree layout ideal for graphs with many horizontal branches.

**Features:**
- Left-to-right flow
- Better use of screen width
- Customizable spacing
- Ideal for wide graphs

**Use when:** Your call graph is wide rather than deep.

---

### 8. ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline Layout
**Best for:** Performance analysis and execution order

Arranges functions horizontally based on their total execution time, creating a performance timeline.

**Features:**
- Sorted by execution time
- Linear arrangement
- Performance comparison
- Time-based ordering

**Use when:** You want to identify performance bottlenecks at a glance.

---

### 9. üåø Organic (Spring) Layout
**Best for:** Natural, aesthetically pleasing visualizations

Uses Barnes-Hut algorithm for a natural, spring-based layout with advanced physics simulation.

**Features:**
- Advanced physics (Barnes-Hut)
- Natural node distribution
- Overlap avoidance
- Smooth animations

**Use when:** You want the most natural-looking and aesthetically pleasing layout.

## Layout Customization

### Node Spacing Options

All layouts support customizable node spacing:

- **Compact (100px):** Dense layout for large graphs
- **Normal (150px):** Default balanced spacing
- **Relaxed (200px):** More breathing room
- **Wide (300px):** Maximum spacing for detailed analysis

### Physics Control

Toggle physics simulation on/off:
- **Enabled:** Dynamic, interactive positioning
- **Disabled:** Static, fixed positioning

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from callflow_tracer import trace_scope

with trace_scope("output.html"):
    # Your traced code here
    main()
```

The generated HTML will include all layout options in the dropdown menu.

### Programmatic Layout Selection

```python
from callflow_tracer import export_html, get_current_graph

# Get the current call graph
graph = get_current_graph()

# Export with specific layout (default)
export_html(graph, "output.html", layout="hierarchical")
```

### Interactive Controls

When you open the generated HTML file, you'll find:

1. **Layout Dropdown:** Switch between all 9 layouts
2. **Node Spacing:** Adjust spacing (Compact/Normal/Relaxed/Wide)
3. **Physics Toggle:** Enable/disable physics simulation
4. **Module Filter:** Filter by specific modules
5. **Export Options:** Save as PNG or JSON
