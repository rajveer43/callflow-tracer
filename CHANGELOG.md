## [0.2.4] - 2025-10-07

### New
- **Async/Await Tracing**
  - `@trace_async`, `trace_scope_async()` for async code
  - `gather_traced()` to track concurrent task execution
  - `AsyncCallGraph` and `get_async_stats()` for timeline and concurrency metrics
- **Comparison Mode**
  - `compare_graphs()` to compute before/after diffs
  - `export_comparison_html()` split-screen HTML with improvements/regressions
- **Memory Leak Detection**
  - `MemoryLeakDetector`, `detect_leaks()` context manager
  - `@track_allocations` decorator and `MemorySnapshot`
  - `find_reference_cycles()`, `get_memory_growth()`, `get_top_memory_consumers()`
  - Beautiful HTML leak reports with Chart.js (growth, type distribution, snapshots, recommendations)

### Improvements
- HTML UI/UX: Fixed module filtering (with smooth fit animation), corrected Circular/Timeline layouts, improved JSON export (no `network.getData()`), modern CPU profile panel (collapsible)
- Documentation: Added `docs/v0_2_4_features.md`, expanded `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`, updated `docs/index.md`

## Migration Guide

### From 0.2.2 to Latest

#### No Breaking Changes!
All existing code continues to work. New features are opt-in.

#### New Features Available

**Enhanced Flamegraph**:
```python
# Old way (still works)
generate_flamegraph(graph, "output.html")

# New way (with all features)
generate_flamegraph(
    graph,
    "output.html",
    color_scheme="performance",  # NEW!
    show_stats=True,             # NEW!
    search_enabled=True          # NEW!
)
```

**Jupyter Integration**:
```python
# NEW! Use in Jupyter notebooks
from callflow_tracer.jupyter import display_callgraph

with trace_scope() as graph:
    my_function()

display_callgraph(graph.to_dict())
```

**Fixed Features**:
- CPU profiling now shows actual times (no code changes needed)
- Module filter now works (just use it in HTML)
- All layouts work (select in HTML)
- JSON export works (no code changes needed)
